# Escape
## Project Overview
Welcome to Escape, a captivating rocket launch simulation using OpenGL and Python! This project visualizes the thrilling process of a rocket launch, from countdown to lift-off, all the way to its journey in the sky. The simulation features a play button to initiate the countdown, realistic starry sky, moon, and detailed rocket movements.

## Features
### Play Button:
Starts the countdown for the rocket launch.

### Countdown Timer:
Displays a 3-second countdown before the rocket launch sequence begins.

### Realistic Rocket Launch:
Animates the rocket launch, including fumes and boosters.

###Starry Sky and Moon:
Creates a realistic outer space environment with stars and a moon.

### Grass and Launch Pad:
Simulates the rocket launch site with grass and a launch pad.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x
PyOpenGL
GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## Installation
### Clone the Repository

`sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/escape.git
cd escape
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
`
sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv

If requirements.txt is not available, install the dependencies manually:

sh
Copy code
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
Usage
Run the Simulation

sh
Copy code
